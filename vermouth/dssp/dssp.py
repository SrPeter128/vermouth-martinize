    Adds the DSSP assignation to the atoms of a molecule.

    Runs DSSP on the molecule and adds the secondary structure assignation as

    Only proteins can be annotated. Non-protein molecules are returned
    unmodified, so are empty molecules, and molecules for which no positions
    are set.

    The atom names are assumed to be compatible with DSSP. Atoms with no known

    Convert a sequence of secondary structure to martini secondary sequence.

    Martini treats some secondary structures with less resolution than dssp.
    For instance, the different types of helices that dssp discriminates are
    seen the same by martini. Yet, different parts of the same helix are seen
    differently in martini.

    In the Martini force field, the B and E secondary structures from DSSP are
    both treated as extended regions. All the DSSP helices are treated the
    same, but the different part of the helices (beginning, end, core of a
    short helix, core of a long helix) are treated differently.

    After the conversion, the secondary structures are:
    * :F: Collagenous Fiber
    * :E: Extended structure (Î² sheet)
    * :H: Helix structure
    * :1: Helix start (H-bond donor)
    * :2: Helix end (H-bond acceptor)
